# Drone Shop Inventory App

Build an app which allows a Drone Shopkeeper to track their Drone Shop's Inventory. 
This is not an app that customers will see; it is an administration and management app for the shop workers to use.

## Features

- The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.

- The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.

- The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.

- This might mean that it makes more sense for a drone shop to track manufacturer, models, and prices of the drones, etc.

- You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate for your project.

- Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.

- As well as showing the stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.

## Technologies Used

- Python3
- PostgreSQL
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete Operations)
- Flask
